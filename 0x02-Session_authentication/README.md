# 0x02. Session Authentication

## Overview

This project involves implementing a **Session Authentication** mechanism for a simple API. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how session authentication works, including the use of cookies to manage user sessions. This project should not use any external modules beyond the standard Python library.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the purpose of authentication and how it is implemented in web applications.
- Understand what session authentication is and how it differs from other authentication methods.
- Describe what cookies are and how they are used to manage user sessions.
- Implement session authentication using cookies in a Flask application.

## Key Concepts

- **Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a user or service.
- **Session Authentication**: A mechanism where the server maintains a session for each user, identified by a session ID stored in a cookie.
- **Cookies**: Small pieces of data sent from the server to the client, stored locally, and included in subsequent requests to maintain stateful sessions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Flask (a micro web framework for Python)
- No additional modules should be installed
- Code should follow the PEP 8 style guide (version 2.5)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 installed on your system. You can verify your installation by running:

```bash
python3 --version

```
