# 0x01. Basic Authentication

This project explores the concept of authentication, specifically focusing on implementing Basic Authentication on a simple API using Python. The purpose is to gain a thorough understanding of how authentication works by manually implementing it, rather than relying on libraries or frameworks.

## Background Context

Authentication is a critical aspect of security in software development. In real-world applications, you should typically use established libraries or frameworks to handle authentication. However, this project involves manually implementing Basic Authentication to understand its mechanism better. 

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/rest-api-authentication)
- [Base64 in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html)
- [HTTP header Authorization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Base64 - concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what authentication means in software systems.
- Describe the concept and purpose of Base64 encoding.
- Encode a string using Base64 in Python.
- Explain the mechanism of Basic Authentication.
- Send the `Authorization` header in HTTP requests.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
- Documentation should be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
